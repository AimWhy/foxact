## Features

#### React 18 Safe

All hooks and utils are React 18+ Concurrent Rendering resilient. We **strictly follow React best practices and never read and write ref during the render phase** (unlike many other open-sourced React Hooks libraries). You can use **foxact** with `<Suspense />`, `startTransition`, `<OffScreen />` without worrying about app falling apart.

#### SSR Friendly

Works perfectly with server-side rendering, incremental static generation, and static site generation.

Supports [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (both Pages Directory and App Router), [Waku](https://github.com/dai-shi/waku), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Remix](https://remix.run/), and [Shopify Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/).


#### Type Safe and Sound

Written in TypeScript, supports TypeScript 4.8+.

#### Super Lightweight

The entire **foxact** library has zero dependencies and is **less than 5 KiB gzipped in sum**. And what's more...

#### Fully Tree Shakable

Feel free to take what you want from **foxact** without worrying about client bundle size.
