# Best Practice

## Destructuring

Some of the React Hooks in `foxact` will return **an object of memoized values**. You can use [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to extract the values you need, e.g:

```tsx
import { useClipboard } from 'foxact/use-clipboard';

export default function App() {
  const { copied, copy } = useClipboard();
  const handleCopyButtonClick = useCallback(() => copy('Hello World'), [copy]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleCopyButtonClick}>{copied ? 'Copied' : 'Copy Hello World'}</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, the `copy` function returned by `useClipboard` is memoized, so it's safe to use it as a dependency in the `useCallback` hook.

Other more re-usable utilities and hooks from `foxact` will return **an array of memoized values**, so you can give them a more descriptive name by using [array destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Array_destructuring), e.g:

```tsx
// src/context/provider.tsx
import { createContextState } from 'foxact/context-state';

const [TokenProvider, useToken, useSetToken] = createContextState<string | null>(null);
const [SidebarActiveProvider, useSidebarActive, useSetSidebarActive] = createContextState(false);

const Provider = ({ children }: React.PropsWithChildren) => (
  <TokenProvider>
    <SidebarActiveProvider>
      {children}
    </SidebarActiveProvider>
  </TokenProvider>
);

export {
  Provider,
  useToken, useSetToken,
  useSidebarActive, useSetSidebarActive
};

// src/App.tsx
import { useIntersection } from 'foxact/use-intersection';

const [setAvatarIntersection, isAvatarIntersected, resetAvatarIsIntersected] = useIntersection<HTMLImageElement>();
const [setThumbnailIntersection, isThumbnailIntersected, resetThumbnailIsIntersected] = useIntersection<HTMLImageElement>();
const setToken = useSetToken();
```

And returned functions (like `setAvatarIntersection`, `resetAvatarIsIntersected`, `setThumbnailIntersection`, `resetThumbnailIsIntersected`, and `setToken`) are always memoized, so it's safe to add them to any dependencies array.

## Why / Why not

### Global state management library vs useContext + useState

Global state management libraries (like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)) usually store the state outside of React, then use `useSyncExternalState` to sync the state into the React.

`useSyncExternalState` is a new React built-in hook introduced in React 18. It is a trade-off between React Concurrent Rendering and consistency (without tearing). Currently (React 18.2), when React encounters `useSyncExternalState` during the concurrent rendering, React will "de-optimize" and fall back to the synchronous rendering (slower and less responsive) to make sure there is no inconsistency (tearing). Only states stored inside of React (using `useState` and `useReducer`) are concurrent-rendering-friendly.

Global state management libraries are indeed very powerful and great for React application that has complex logic and complicated data flow. But most of the time, a simple state shared across the application is good enough.
