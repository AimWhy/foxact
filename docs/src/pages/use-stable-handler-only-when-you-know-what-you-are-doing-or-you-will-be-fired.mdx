# useStableHandler (only use when you know what you are doing, or you will be fired)

import ExportMetaInfo from '../components/export-meta-info';

<ExportMetaInfo />

A userland implementation of React 18.3 `useEffectEvent` with the returned function memoized.

## Rules

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Failed to comply will result in you being fired, literally.**
</Callout>

The hook **IS ONLY FOR**:

- Passing event handlers to custom React Hooks that does not use `useEffect`
  - The passed event handler **must not be** fired inside `useEffect`, which you should use React's `useEffectEvent` instead.
  - https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#passing-event-handlers-to-custom-hooks

The hook **IS NOT FOR**:

- Replacing the `useCallback`
- Replacing the `useEffectEvent`
- Memoizing selector function of global state management libraries
  - Use `useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector` instead
  - https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/86
- Separating Events Handler from Effects
  - Use React's `useEffectEvent` instead
  - https://react.dev/learn/separating-events-from-effects#declaring-an-effect-event

## Difference with React's `useEffectEvent`

- `useEffectEvent` is implemented in React, while `useStableHandler` is implemented in userland.
- The returned function of `useStableHandler` is always memoized, while the return value of `useEffectEvent` **is guaranteed to not be memoized at all**
- The returned function of `useEffectEvent` can not be called during the render phase.
  - Although the returned function `useStableHandler` **should not be called during the render phase as well**, it is implemented in a way to only prevent invocation during the render phase before the first mount.
  - **You will also be fired if you try to exploit this implementation detail**.

## When you don't need `useStableHandler`

You don't necessarily need `useStableHandler` if you are just passing a reducer-like function to a custom hook.

See this GitHub commit [`sukkaw/foxact @ 5934ed8`](https://github.com/SukkaW/foxact/commit/5934ed8f27f6a3acba4cb332b431c9e820fceeda) for an example, where I drop the `useStableHandler` from foxact's [`useUncontrolled`](/use-uncontrolled).

## Usage

```tsx
import { useStableHandler } from 'foxact/use-stable-handler-only-when-you-know-what-you-are-doing-or-you-will-be-fired';
```

The detailed usage and the example are **intentionally** redacted.
